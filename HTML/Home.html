        <p class="p1">Hi, I'm Paul Nguyen, an audio engineer online who thrives on making sound work for you. Whether it’s tracking in the studio, mixing and mastering, or polishing post-production audio, I bring a keen ear, solid technical skills, and a collaborative mindset.
            Over 3 years I’ve helped artists, podcasters and content creators turn good recordings into great ones by:
            - Mastering industry-standard tools (Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Ableton, etc) and gear to capture and shape sound with clarity.
            - Working under pressure in live environments and studio sessions, solving technical problems on the fly so creative momentum isn’t lost. 
            - Focusing on the listener’s experience: clean mixes, immersive soundscapes, and a final product that stands out. 
            What I offer:
            - Studio recording & mixing, mastering (from tracking to final mix)
            - Post-production audio (podcasts, commercials, film)
            
            If you’re an artist ready to elevate your sound, a content creator needing reliable audio support, or a podcast/film producer seeking crisp, professional audio — let’s connect and talk about your next project.</p>
